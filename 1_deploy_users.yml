          User deployment completed successfully!
          ======================================
          Users 'lcs' and 'deploy' have been created with SSH key authentication.
          SSH key login has been tested and verified.

          You can now run the SSH hardening playbook (2_harden_ssh.yml) to disable
          password authentication and enforce key-only access.
